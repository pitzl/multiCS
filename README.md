## Multiple Coulomb Scattering of electrons in matter

F. Salvat, J.D. Martinez, R. Mayol, J. Parellada:  
A Monte Carlo program to simulate the penetration and energy loss of keV
electrons through matter  
Computer Physics Communications 42 (1986) 93â€”104

Code mcsda.f stored as AALC at the CPC program library in Belfast: http://cpc.cs.qub.ac.uk/

translated into Fortran 90 and C++
- multics.f90  Fortran90
- multicspp.cpp  plain C++
- multics.cc with ROOT, vertical through a thin infinite layer
- edgesc.cc with ROOT, edge-on through a thin layer

Successfully applied to the multiple scattering of GeV electrons in thin
( 0.1 mm to 5 mm ) layers of silicon.

The energy loss calculation uses the original Landau theory (d sigma/d dE ~ 1/dE^2)
without shell corrections and only approximates the width and most probable value
of the distribton, while the mean value is quite OK (Bethe-Bloch).

## bugs fixed from mcsda.f

- CALL RMBRG( rngd, EC, E, D, 1D-6, 10, 6 ) ! 10 gets overwritten!

  SUBROUTINE RMBRG( fct, XL, XU, Y, EPS, NPART, IPRNT )  

  NPART = -NPART ! flag low accuracy

- NaN: bug in DIRECT
  U = AW*DSQRT( 1D0-V*V-W*W ) ! NaN

- DIRECT is wrong at small angles
  completely changed with proper rotation matrix
  multiple scattering correct down to mrad for GeV electrons

- Wentzel model needs AA1 but it is not assigned in case of IS = 0
